<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>Most of my work belongs to my employers.<br />
There are however three exceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/arvenil/kata">Kata 形</a> is my recent toy project to show of my skills in algorithms and idiomatic Go.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/uniplaces/osin-dynamodb">osin-dynamodb</a> is a Go library which implements the storage for <a href="https://github.com/RangelReale/osin">OSIN</a> with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> using <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">aws-sdk-go</a>. I&rsquo;ve created it for storing OAuth credentials in DynamoDB in one of my projects at <a href="uniplaces.com">Uniplaces</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/arvenil/ninja-mutex">ninja-mutex</a> <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/arvenil/ninja-mutex"><img src="https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/arvenil/ninja-mutex.svg" alt="Total Downloads" /></a> is a simple to use mutex implementation for php. It supports different adapters (flock, memcache, mysql, redis, &hellip;) so you can set it up as you wish. All adapters (if set up properly) can be used in multi server environment - in other words lock is shared between web servers. I&rsquo;ve created it as a demo of my skills, a demo I could show on job interviews.</li>
</ol>

<p>All those projects show some of my skills, coding standards and love for testing.</p>
