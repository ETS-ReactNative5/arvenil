### Demo

Most of my work belongs to my employers.  
There are however three exceptions:

1. [Kata 形] is my recent toy project to show of my skills in algorithms and idiomatic Go.
2. [osin-dynamodb] is a Go library which implements the storage for [OSIN](https://github.com/RangelReale/osin) with [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) using [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go). I've created it for storing OAuth credentials in DynamoDB in one of my projects at [Uniplaces](https://www.uniplaces.com/).
3. [ninja-mutex][] [![downloads]][packagist] is a simple to use mutex implementation for php. It supports different adapters (flock, memcache, mysql, redis, ...) so you can set it up as you wish. All adapters (if set up properly) can be used in multi-server environment - in other words lock is shared between web servers. I've created it as a demo of my skills, a demo I could show on job interviews.

All those projects show some of my skills, coding standards and love for testing.
