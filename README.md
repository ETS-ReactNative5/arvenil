# Hi,

My Name is Kamil Dziedzic, a Backend Developer, former IT manager and former full-stack web developer aspiring to become proper Software Engineer for the next generation internet - decentralized, private and encrypted.

Will you help me?

I'm looking for opportunities to widen my knowledge, experience and expertise in software development alongside with a steady source of income to pursue my dream of building decentralized apps of the future.

Feel free to contact me via email [hire@golang.guru](mailto:hire@golang.guru)

## What can I offer?

* open mind
* 10 years experience in web app development, product building and team leading
* dedication to learn new languages and technologies
* 4+ years experience with golang (standalone programs and web apis) and 0.5 year with gomobile
* 10+ years in building REST apis
* 5+ years with testing and TDD
* 6+ years with MySQL, 0.5 year with Amazon DynamoDB, some experience with Memcached and MongoDB 
* 6+ years with Agile, Kanban and Scrum (Professional Scrum Master I certificate in 2012)
* some experience with javascript apps e.g. AngularJS and node.js, far from feeling comfortable to say I'm js developer, but I'm comfortable to begin working on professional apps. It's also something I want to be more serious about as this seems to be one of the best option to write cross-platform, distributed apps with nice gui 
* 6+ years with developing PHP apps, while I'm not interested in writing php code anymore I can still read it :)
* communicative English with Polish accent ;)
* "¿Qué hora es?" level of Spanish ;) I'm currently living in Spain so I hope to learn more as soon as possible :)
* basic photography skills

### Skills and buzzwords

Feel free to use below list to quickly check if I might have desired skills

### Demo

Sadly most of my work ever done is closed source and belongs to my employers.  
There are however two exceptions:

1. [osin-dynamodb](https://github.com/uniplaces/osin-dynamodb) is a small golang library which implements the storage for [OSIN](https://github.com/RangelReale/osin) with [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) using [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go). I've created it for storing OAuth credentials in DynamoDB in one of my projects at [Uniplaces](uniplaces.com). It was released to public with MIT license
2. [ninja-mutex](https://github.com/arvenil/ninja-mutex) is a simple to use mutex implementation for php. It supports different adapters (flock, memcache, mysql, redis, ...) so you can setup it as you wish. All adapters (if set up properly) can be used in multi server environment - in other words lock is shared between web servers. I've created it as a demo of my skills, a demo I could show on job interviews :) Packagist [![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/arvenil/ninja-mutex.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/arvenil/ninja-mutex) so not so bad for a demo project :) 

Both projects show some of my skills, coding standards and love for testing.


## What can you offer me?

* steady income (I need to eat, pay rent, read books, watch movies, have fun, support my photography hobby - this requires some coins)
* opportunities to learn about blockchain, ipfs, bitcoin and everything else related to distributed network at work or in spare time
* position in Research and Development
* opportunity to learn new programming language
* opportunity to work and exchange knowledge with a team of specialists
* in work time to share knowledge via blogs and talks
* experience with already known technologies
* more international experience in product building and team leading
* opportunity to learn new language (e.g. would love to learn Spanish and proper English)
* office space
* opportunities to travel

## Interested? Sent me a message!


Do you think my skills could be useful for your company or clients? Can you offer me anything from the list above?

Great! Please contact me via email [hire@golang.guru](mailto:hire@golang.guru) or bleep `c4afb2a4c29d9211c6a751226b829dc40fa82972f7e6765d9cd8f699999aaa0e,golang.guru`

Thanks to gomobile I've build SDK application for Android and iOS
- common application layer for Android and iOS mobile apps
- simplified development as common logic could be encapsulated in library that Android and iOS developers can use in their apps
- gomobile allows to build fully native apps, but writing just a common library gives Android and iOS developers free hand at designing native frontend part of their app
